1. Algorithms on Library Management System

step1: start
step2:open Library Management System website/app
step3:select the user type either student or management staff
      if the student/management staff is not registered then click on register button/icon
step4:enter the details for register the process
      after registering you will recive the OTP on your mobile number/email id
      if OTP is recived enter the OTP  else resend the OTP, after receving the OTP login   using username and password
step5:after sucessfull login you will be entered to the library
step6:now a student/staff enter in to the library and ask to the librarian for searching the required books
step7: enter library database if u find the book give the sitting position
      else print book is not available
step8:after reading the book 
      if you want to return the book to librarian,enter the student/staff member id and   submit the book and you will receive a notification to email id/mobile number as book is     returned 
     else if you wants to borrow/take the book, scan your id and you will recive a notification to email id/mobile number as book is issued
step9:stop

3. Algorithms restaurant management system:
     a. Order management algorithm
     b. Kitchen management algorithm 
     c. Employee management algorithm


a. Order management algorithm 

step 1: Start
step 2: receive the menu
step 3: search for the good food and cost
step 4: cost min 100
step 5: order
step 6: receive another menu
step 7: cost>100
step 8: order
step 9:The ordered food taken to the kitchen department
step 9: stop


b. Kitchen management algorithm:

step 1: start
step 2: Accept the order from the customer
step 3: After accepting the order
step 4: see for ordered ingridents to make food
step 5: if items are available or not
step 6: item is available
step 7: start to prepare
step 8: After making food give it to the customer from kitchen
step 9: stop

c. Employee management system:

step 1: start
step 2: interview process
step 3: if selected
step 4: submitting the documents
step 5: joining as employee
